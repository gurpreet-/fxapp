# FxApp

A currency conversion app written in Jetpack Compose using an MVVM architecture.  Currently this app supports `EUR`, `GBP` and `USD` and shows a list of currencies that any amount you provide gets converted to.

#### Performance
The app is using a reactive view system known as Jetpack Compose which only updates when a `Flow` updates its data. I initially did not want to use `UIState` view-holders as they can lead to more frequent updates to a screen than necessary. Though, by guiding developers, I can ensure they use multiple `UIState`s per `ViewModel` thereby ensuring an update doesn't lead to whole pages updating.

I've tried to use as little dependencies as possible in order to not bloat the app and keep build times fast.

#### Maintainability
- As mentioned above, I've used little external dependencies.
- 99% of logic is out of any view and in my ViewModels/Models which have tests written for them.
- Use of `ViewModels` retain state across configuration changes, leading to less code in the view dealing with state based code. They also morph business logic gathered from our `Models` to a more presentable format.
- Use of `Models` compartmentalise business logic.

#### Security
The app has been setup to interface with the outside world using HTTPS2 and all user stored data is encrypted. Further work can be done to add DexGuard to detect rooted devices and scramble code effectively.

#### Simplicity
The app does not use any external complex math libraries or classes that have been bodged in. The app has an architecture (MVVM) that is consistent with Google's recommended approach and therefore it's easier for less experienced members of the team to get up-to-speed with especially as most documentation is in Compose.

Kotlin coroutines make it easy to perform intense work that should be kept away from the main thread. `JobExecutor` provides an easy abstraction layer in creating units of asynchronous work.

#### Scalability
The app can be geared up to use build variants. We can have a build variant for I've added a `BuildWrapper` class that can be injected into almost anywhere that is able to provide different configurations based on devices and specific API levels.

I've targeted a low `minSdk` level to ensure maximum developer convenience whilst still being able to install on many devices.

Further work can be done to use GraphQL which provides an ever-updating contract between client and server, rather than interfacing with a HTTP server.

#### Readability
It has an easy to comprehend folder structure:
- üóÇÔ∏è di - for dependency injection
- üóÇÔ∏è repository - for any network abstractions
- üóÇÔ∏è data - for any data classes
- üóÇÔ∏è viewmodel - for viewmodels
- üóÇÔ∏è model - for our models (business logic)
- üóÇÔ∏è view - for any compose/activity/fragment/custom views

It also has an easy to comprehend module structure:
- libfoundation - imported into every module that provides all our common classes
- libtest - imported into every module and provides test-only dependencies
- feature`<name>` - for any feature modules
- app - main module

With the above module structure, we can use [Play On-Demand delivery](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/feature-delivery/on-demand) to download modules ad-hoc lowering the size of the initial download.

The code itself is well formatted and offers no grammatical mistakes. Good naming conventions are used for variables and where possible in-keeping with Android's guidelines.


## Building and running

### Requirements
- Android Studio - Android Studio Iguana | 2023.2.1 Patch 1
- In order to build the app, you need the Android SDK. It's usually downloaded and installed in your home folder when you install Android Studio.
- The app targets API 34 so installing an image version equivalent or close to that API would be ideal.

## Running tests

### Unit tests
- Tests are written in JUnit.
- Right-clicking the top-most folder this app is hosted in, click `Run All Tests`.

### UI tests
- Please run all tests on an emulator/device with API 28 or higher. This constraint comes about by mockk, the mocking framework I'm using.
- All UI tests are located in `app/src/androidTest`, so right-clicking that folder and clicking `Run..` will allow you to run those tests.

## Things to note
- UI Tests only run on emulators/devices running API 28 or above.
- The amount field does have some quirky behaviour when typing and sometimes pushes the cursor back. Given more time I can alleviate these issues.
- I have tested many components but due to time constraints some wrapper classes I have not been able to test. Though the essentials are all tested `ViewModels` and `Model` and of course the view.
- The app uses `Fragments` and is not 100% Compose. Why? Navigation in pure Compose is an arduous task especially if you have state in different screens. Navigation using the standard `Fragment` based approach which is in a battle-tested library is much easier (although you have to write more shell `Fragments`) and works well with different components such as the side drawer and bottom navigation bar.
